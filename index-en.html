      <p><strong>Our parents passed away and we found ourselves alone against the world</strong></p>

      <p>
        Life has challenged us in ways I never imagined facing at such a young age. <strong>We lost our father, our mother...</strong> and this year, our grandfather too. Now it's just me, Gui, and our uncle trying to hold everything together.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Guilherme is a very special child. He has infantile cerebral palsy and needs 24-hour care ‚Äî for eating, bathing, sleeping, everything. On top of that, he suffers from frequent seizures and convulsions.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Since we've been on our own, I've done everything humanly possible to give Gui a dignified life, but I have to be honest: it's getting harder every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're in a desperate situation now. I'm unemployed, drowning in debt, behind on rent, and often without money for food. Gui's basic needs ‚Äî diapers, hygiene items, proper nutrition, medications, and transportation to medical appointments ‚Äî simply can't be covered by what little government assistance we receive.
      </p>

      <p>
        "<strong>I've been trying to survive doing small jobs as a caricature artist, but it's nowhere near enough for everything we need.</strong>"
      </p>

      <p>
        These are the thoughts that make me <strong>cry alone in the bathroom</strong> every night.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've thought about giving up many times... <strong>Sadness and anxiety have become constant companions. But when I look at my brother, I remember why I'm here. He's my motivation. My purpose. I will never abandon him.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Being his brother isn't easy. But it's the greatest gift I've ever received. Gui teaches me about love every day ‚Äî even without speaking a single word.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the truth is... <strong>we've reached a breaking point.</strong> I'm unemployed. The debts keep piling up. The rent is overdue. Sometimes we don't even have food to eat. And Gui's basic needs ‚Äî diapers, special formula, medication, hygiene products ‚Äî simply can't be covered by the little we get from the government.
      </p>

      <p>
        I try to make some money as a caricature artist, drawing at parties, events, or taking commissions. But it's very, very little.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then I look at Guilherme... and I remember why I'm here.

He depends on me. And I promised myself that as long as I'm alive, he will never be abandoned. Never.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've thought about giving up so many times. Sometimes the sadness hits so hard that I wonder if I can keep going.

But then I look at Guilherme... and I remember why I'm here.

He depends on me. And I promised myself that as long as I'm alive, he will never be abandoned. Never.

      <p>If you're reading this now, I'm asking you with an open heart: please help us.

Watch our video. See with your own eyes who Guilherme is, who we are.

If you can donate any amount, know that you'll be helping two siblings continue fighting together ‚Äî with dignity, with love, with hope.

You could be the difference between pain and relief. Between despair and hope.
